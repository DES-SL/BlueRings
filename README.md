# BlueRings

An extended re-implementation of Gavazzi et al's RingFinder galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens detection robot. Subtract red light from blue, analyze residuals, classify. Helping find lenses in the DES images since May 2016.

For an introduction to the basic method, check out the original paper: ["RingFinder: automated detection of galaxy-scale gravitational lenses in ground-based multi-filter imaging data" by Raphael Gavazzi et al (2014)](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1041). We are trying to extend this method to be able to make *color residuals*, and are investigating improved ways to interpret those residuals.
